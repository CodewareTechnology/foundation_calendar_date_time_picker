(Thank you Date.js)\r\n- 2/6/2014 -> Added a UTC offset calculation option that calculates the display time with an offset from UTC, and then stores the selected values as the properly calculated UTC time.\r\n\r\n##License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 John \"Jocko\" S.

Here's the list:\r\n\r\n- __Foundation__ -- Well, this is a foundation plugin, so we might as well include that, because without it we're nothing.\r\n- __Foundation Icon Fonts 3__ -- Another external dependency, but this one is used to create a better UI than would be available through my CSS skills.  The source can be [found here](http://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3), but it's also included in this repository.\r\n- __jQuery__ -- Well, it's jQuery, it's included in the repo.\r\n- __date.js__ -- This is a date manipulation plugin that I didn't write myself.  It can be [found here](http://www.datejs.com/).  It's a pretty cool little tool for date manipulation.  Ideally, it would be nice to just build the date calculations necessary to make Calendar work, and leave the rest out, that way it's more light-weight not externally dependent.\r\n- __date-helpers.js__ -- This is my own Date modification and manipulation helpers.  They are included in the repo, and built into the minified version of foundation_calendar.js.\r\n- __string-helpers.js__ -- This is my own String modification and manipulation helpers.  They are included in the repo, and built into the minified version of foundation_calendar.js.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThe index.html file in the repository gives a full description of how to install and use the plugin.  Read the &lt;head&gt; section of the html to see the file requirements, and view the file to read about how to implement the plugin.\r\n\r\n## Customization\r\n\r\nIf you want to customize the styles of the UI, you can do it directly through the foundation_calendar.css file, or you can add the _calendar.scss file to your Foundation SCSS components directory.  \r\n\r\nIf you're using SCSS, don't forget to make sure your foundation.scss file imports the _calendar.scss file appropriately. Have fun!!!\r\n","google":"UA-27128583-3","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
